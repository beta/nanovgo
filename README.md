# NanoVGo

NanoVGo is a Go binding for [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg), a small antialiased vector graphics rendering library for OpenGL.

NanoVGo is in an early stage. Frequent changes to the APIs are expected, which will become stable after the 1.0.0 version.

Please note that NanoVGo is a Go binding created with Cgo, instead of a Go port. For a Go port of the NanoVG library, please refer to [shibukawa/nanovgo](https://github.com/shibukawa/nanovgo).
